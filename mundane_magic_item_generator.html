<h1>Random Mundane Magic Item Generator</h1>

<p>This page provides a set of lists used to generate single-use mundane magical items for your fantasy roleplaying game of choice. You can roll on <a href="#lists">each list</a> to generate an item at the table or you can print out the <a href="#100items">1d100 magic item list</a> and roll against that. Reloading this page will build a new list of 100 random magic items.

<p>You can also <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/slyflourish_content/random_mundane_magic_items.pdf">download a random mundane magic item PDF</a> to keep in your <a href="http://slyflourish.com/dm_walk_away_kit.html">GM kit</a>.

<p>These items are intended to be single-use items. When activated the powers on these items work either only once or for about five minutes. The quirks also last about five minutes when the item is activated. These items are intended to be interesting but not particularly powerful.

<p>In order to ensure your group doesn't horde these items, you may make the quirks more severe the more items one possesses. Three is probably a good number. If the PC has more than three of these items in their possession, the quirks get more severe when they're used. It's up to the GM to decide how severe. You might even stack quirks if you want.

<p>The descriptions of these items are purposefully vague and include no mechanics. This lets GMs work with players to decide how they actually work and lets them work in just about any fantasy RPG of your choice. If you need further guidance on how these powers work, take a look at the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/indexes/spells.htm">d20 SRD spell descriptions</a> that inspired many of these powers.
